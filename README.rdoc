# alternate-folder

# Information

This is a simple program that stores local_folder => remote_server:remote_folder mappings in ~/.afrc. When it is run, it'll attempt to transfer you to your defined remote. If one doesn't exist, it'll ask for one to be created. 

# Usage

## Install the gem
  gem install alternate-folder

## Run it
  $ af

## Change a mapping later
  $ af --change
